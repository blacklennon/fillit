# fillit

This is fillit, a project from 42 school.

## Installation
Just do a `make` and use it like `./fillit fillit_map`

## Configuration
In the `includes/fillit.h` file, there is some preprocessor variables to pimp the fillit a little bit.
- `DEBUG`: If set to 1, errors will become verbose.
- `TETRI_*`: These variables are not working properly, but you can make them work. Actually the fillit is just working with defaults 42's subject values.
